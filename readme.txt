Try out **WordPress** **Game** **List** right now! 

== Installation ==

**Method** **1)** Simply drop this folder (unzipped) into your WordPress plugin directory (/wp-content/plugins).

**Method** **2)** In the WordPress admin dashboard, click on ‘Plugins’ on the left-hand side, click on ‘Add New’ towards the very top of the page, click on ‘Upload Plugin’, and upload the ‘wpgamelist.zip’ file you downloaded.

**Method** **3)** In the WordPress admin dashboard, click on ‘Plugins’ on the left-hand side, click on ‘Add New’ towards the very top of the page, search for ‘wpgamelist’, and then click ‘Install Now’.

**USAGE:** Simply paste this shortcode on the page or post you’d like to display your library: [wpgamelist_shortcode], visit that page or post on the front-end (like a visitor to your website would do), and look for the "Add a Game" link. Click on it, enter the ISBN number of the game you'd like to add, fill out the other fields (if you'd like, the only required field is the ISBN number), and click 'Add Game!'

== Screenshots ==

1. How your games will appear on your website. WPGameList uses most of the default styling of your currently active theme.
2. Another shot of the same page scrolled further down. WPBookList utilizes a handy, customizable pagination feature.
3. This is how your games will appear when you click on a title or cover image.
4. This is another example of how your games will appear when you click on a title or cover image - this time highlighting one of the best games of all time!
5. An example of how the Similar Titles & Products and Summary sections look for each title
6. Here's a title whose Notes section has been put to good use, being utilized to share a review of Dark Souls.
7. Here's how an automatically-generated WPGameList Page or Post could look. When adding a game, you'll have the option to have WPGameList automatically create Pages and Posts for your games. 
8. A screenshot of the 'Add a Game' menu page of WPGameList. Simply search for a title, and add a game that shows up below!
9. Here's the form that get's automatically populated with game data once you've selected a game. Alternatively, you can simply fill out this form with your own information if you don't feel like automatically importing data from IGDB.
10. A screenshot of the Display Options page in the WordPress Dashboard. Here you can control which elements actually get displayed on the page you’ve placed your game library on, as well as which items are displayed in the Game View (the pop-up window that appears when clicking on a Cover Image/Title).
11. Here you can create additional game libraries, for example, you could create a ‘Currently Playing’ library, an ‘XBox One’ library, an ‘RPG’ library, or whatever else you can think of!


== Frequently Asked Questions ==

**How do I add a game?** - On the WordPress Dashboard, click on the ‘WPGameList’ link on the left-hand side (marked by a circular icon outlined in green). Search for a game by it's title, click ‘Search for Game’, and give it a second as WPGameList returns 10 results just below. Then, simply click on the game you'd like to add, review the information that is automatically placed in the form below, and click 'Add Game' - that’s it! If you'd rather not gather information about a game from IGDB, you can manually input game data into the form yourself. 

**Why can't WPGameList find my game?** - While WPGameList will have no problem finding the vast majority of games by their Titles alone, occasionally WPGameList will come across a title that it simply can't find information for. WPGameList searches through the database of <a href="https://www.igdb.com/discover">IGDB</a> for information about a title, but the exact data you see when you visit the IGDB site isn't always neccessarily available to software products like WPGameList. Also, <a href="https://www.igdb.com/discover">IGDB</a> functions a bit like Wikipedia, but for games, so if you'd like to contribute by adding a game to IGDB or modifiying the information of an existing game, you can do so!

**Do you provide support for WPGameList?** - Absolutely! If there's something just not right about your WPGameList experience, shoot me an e-mail at <a href="mailto:techsupport@wpgamelist.com">TechSupport@WPGameList.com</a>. I'm also always open to custom development and modifications, so don't hesitate to offer ideas and suggestions!  

**What are all of the Shortcode Options for displaying a Cover Image?** - To display the cover image of a game that links to it’s Amazon page, simply place this shortcode on page or post: [showgamecover]. The available options are as follows:

* Specify a game: title="The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening"
* Set Alignment: align="left" or align="right"
* Specify Library: table="nameoflibrary" (leave out to use default library)
* Set the Display: display="justimage" or display="excerpt"
* Set the Size: width="100"
* Specify the Action:
	action="gameview"
	action="amazon"
	action="gamestop"
	action="bestbuy"
	action="steam"
	action="ebay"

So, for example, to display a game from a library you created named "gameboy", on the left side of a page or post, with a size of 100, this shortcode would do the trick: 

[showgamecover title="The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening" align="left" width="100" table="gameboy"]

Simply leave out the table option to use the default library. 

If all options are left out of the [showgamecover] shortcode, by default WPGameList will display the first game from your default library, aligned to the left, with a size of 100. 

**How Can I Translate WPGameList Into My Language Of Choice?**
So here's the kinda-sorta official way to translate WPGameList:

Head to this link: <a href="https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp-plugins/wpgamelist">https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp-plugins/wpgamelist</a>

Scroll through the list to find the language and locale/dialect you want to translate WPGameList into, and click on the name. On the next page (which should look something like https://translate.wordpress.org/locale/de/formal/wp-plugins/wpgamelist) click on the "Stable (latest release)", and simply work your way down the list, translating string by string into whatever language you're working with. You'll have to be sure to be logged in (log in here: <a href="https://login.wordpress.org/?redirect_to=https%3A%2F%2Ftranslate.wordpress.org%2Fprojects%2Fwp-plugins%2Fwpgamelist%2Fstable%2Fde%2Fformal&locale=en_US">https://login.wordpress.org/?redirect_to=https%3A%2F%2Ftranslate.wordpress.org%2Fprojects%2Fwp-plugins%2Fwpgamelist%2Fstable%2Fde%2Fformal&locale=en_US</a>) before you can provide a translation.

Now when you add these translations, they'll be saved, and an official member of the WordPress translation team will have to 'approve' each one of these translations individually, and it's usually a first-come-first-served-type thing, meaning it could take quite a while. Luckily, you yourself can apply to be one of these "Official Translators", with the ability to approve your own translations.

In order to become one of these "Official Translators", I'll need to know your official username (the one you used to log in at <a href="https://login.wordpress.org/?redirect_to=https%3A%2F%2Ftranslate.wordpress.org%2Fprojects%2Fwp-plugins%2Fwpgamelist%2Fstable%2Fde%2Fformal&locale=en_US">https://login.wordpress.org/?redirect_to=https%3A%2F%2Ftranslate.wordpress.org%2Fprojects%2Fwp-plugins%2Fwpgamelist%2Fstable%2Fde%2Fformal&locale=en_US</a>) and which specific language/dialect you're wanting to be an "Official Translator" of, and then I can send in a request. E-mail me those two bits of information to <a href="mailto:general@wpgamelist.com">general@wpgamelist.com</a>.
